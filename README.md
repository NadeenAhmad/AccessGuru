# AccessGuru

The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities to interact with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page providers. To lower their efforts and, thus, promote inclusiveness, we tackle the problem of automatically discovering and correcting Web accessibility violations in HTML code. While the discovery of syntactic and layout issues was well addressed in related work, the automatic corrections of syntactic, layout, and semantic issues remained unresolved.

Our novel method, AccessGuru, combines existing tools that discover syntactic and layout violations of Web accessibility guidelines and dedicated prompting strategies of Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct semantic, syntactic, and layout violations in HTML code.
To evaluate these new capabilities, we have developed a novel benchmark encompassing Web accessibility violations from real-world Web pages. Our benchmark does not only quantify syntactic compliance but also judges semantic accuracy through a comparative analysis against human expert corrections. Evaluation against our benchmark demonstrates that our solution effectively corrects over 90% of the identified violations,  showing significant improvement over existing methods.
